# Machine Learning Model for Active Ingredient Compatibility in Dermatology

This project implements a machine learning solution to analyze and predict the compatibility of active ingredients in skincare and dermatology products. The system helps users make informed decisions about product combinations while minimizing the risk of adverse reactions.

## Project Overview

The application uses supervised and unsupervised learning techniques to:
- Analyze ingredient interactions
- Predict potential adverse reactions
- Provide data-driven recommendations
- Improve skincare product selection safety

## Features

1. **Data Analysis**
   - Dermatology research integration
   - FDA report analysis
   - Ingredient compatibility studies
   - User-reported interaction tracking

2. **ML Model Components**
   - Ingredient classification
   - Interaction prediction
   - Risk assessment
   - Recommendation engine

3. **User Interface**
